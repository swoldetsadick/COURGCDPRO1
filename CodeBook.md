The run_analysis.R script process can be described as follows:

1) Directely downloads data called getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip from 
"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
to current working directory. Then uncompresses this file creating file UCI HAR Dataset
in current working directory. And loads library `plyr`.

2) Loads and bind by column datasets in **test** and **train** files called `X_같.txt`, 
`y_같.txt`, `subject_같.txt`; replacing 같 by test or train respectively depending on file.

- `subject_같` contains data pretaining to subjects id

- `X_같` contains time and frequency domain variables such as Triaxial acceleration or angular 
	  velocity from the gyroscope carried by subjects and the estimated body acceleration.
	  Read the readme file in UCI HAR Dataset for details.
	
- `y_같` contains data related to activity accomplished by subject


At the end datasets `test_data.csv` and `train_data.csv` coming of column binds of files described 
above in test and train files in UCI HAR Datasets respectively are saved in UCI Result file 
created for the purpose of containing resulting datasets.

3) Loads and relabels columns one and two of both `features.txt` and `activity_labels.txt`
*num* and *labels* respectively and renames these datasets `features.txt_data.csv` and 
`activity_labels.txt_data.csv` respectively. Adding two rows whose values for both variables are
identical and called "id" and "activity". Added in beging and in the end of `features.txt_data.csv`
datasets respectively. [found in UCI Result folder]

- `features.txt_data.csv` contains the labels of columns of `X_test` and `X_train` datasets.
-`activity_labels.txt_data.csv` contains descriptive activity names matching coded ones in
				`Y_test` and `Y_train`

4) Then `features.txt_data.csv` is used on both `test_data.csv` and `train_data.csv` datasets to 
rename columns in a descriptive way.

5) Next `test_data.csv` and `train_data.csv` datasets are joined bind by row. A new dataset called
`1) rbinded.csv` is created. [found in UCI Result folder]

6) However, data pretaining only to mean and std of each measurement is retained. So data with
column names containing string of character mean or std is extracted. The resulting dataset is
called `2) extract.csv` [found in UCI Result folder]

7) Then `activity_labels.txt_data.csv` is used to relabel activities accomplished by each subject
in a descriptive way. The resulting dataset is called `3)and 4) labeled.csv`
[found in UCI Result folder]

8) Last it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject. Appends the suffix _mean to each column of dataset except id and activity 
columns. The resulting dataset is called `5) tidy.txt` [found in UCI Result folder].

**5) tidy.txt dataset is the dataset of interest here.**

5) tidy.txt:  Summary
----------------------

The tidy dataset contains 180 rows over 81 columns.
Each record corresponds to average over activities and subjects of mean and standard deviation of different
Triaxial acceleration or angular velocity from the gyroscope carried by subjects and the estimated body 
acceleration while doing activities described in activity column.

The dataset has no NAs and names of columns are:

5) tidy.txt:  Variable Description and Units
---------------------------------------------

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth 
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. The **acceleration** signal are expressed in 
standard gravity **units 'g'**

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 
tBodyGyroJerkMag). **The units for all angular velocity measures are radians/second.**

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, 
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

"id" is a unique id number assigned to subjects in the study.
"activity" describes activity accomplished by subjects.
